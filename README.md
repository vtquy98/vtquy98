#### Hi there 👋
I’m Thanh Quy Vo, but people call me “Quy.” I’m a frontend developer, and I specialize in efficient React apps and CSS & HTML that just work across all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.

🌱 My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for development awesome website. I have been researching web programming since grade 11 and so on until I graduated from An Giang University. I was really curious about 'techs', so I tried to learn anything that makes me excited about on my own: start internship on a start up company there I was really excited to learn my favorite technology, and it was what I followed today: `ReactJS`, `NodeJS` `Redux`, `NextJS`. I then used them in conjunction with the `Ethereum` Blockchain network for my thesis with [*AGU E-Voting*](https://github.com/vtquy98/E-Voting)  topic and got 9.6 points / 10.

💻 Besides, during my dissertation, I worked as a front end developer at Neetek company from January 2020 with the newly launched project [*9Token.io*](http://wallet.9token.io/). With the trust, I was the one who initiated the front end for that project. Unfortunately COVID-19 virus, we could not find more members for the team, so I alone contributed the front end code for the project with several backend others. That was over six months 😪. It's okay, thanks to that I have learned a lot.

#### Tech stack 💡
I pay special attention to Javascript and their libraries and frameworks: `ReactJS`, `Redux`, `NextJS`.
On the other hand, I've also worked with `NodeJS`, `GraphQL`, `Mongodb`, `Redis`, Blockchain `Ethereum`.
My passion ✊: `Fullstack developer`, `DevOps Engineer`.
